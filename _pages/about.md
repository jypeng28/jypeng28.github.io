## Bio

I am currently a joint PhD student at [University of Science and Technology of China(USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn) and [City University of Hong Kong(CityU)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), advised by Prof. [Qi Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/) and Prof. [Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) . Before that, I graduated from Hefei University of Technology(HFUT), advised by Prof. [Le Wu](http://le-wu.com).

Research areas that I'm interested in (but not limited to) are **Trustworthy Large Language Model**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** and **Recommender System**

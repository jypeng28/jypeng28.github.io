## Bio

I am currently an fourth-year undergraduate student at [Hefei University of Technology(HFUT)](http://www.hfut.edu.cn) in School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, advised by Prof. [Le Wu](http://le-wu.com). I will join USTC CS as a M.S. candidate, advised by Prof. [Qi Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/).

Techniques that I'm interested in (but not limited to) are **Data Mining**, **RS**, and **Trustworthy ML**
